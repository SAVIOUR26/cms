## The Payment Problem

When Western media companies think about digital subscriptions, they think credit cards and PayPal. That works in markets where 70-80% of adults have bank accounts and credit cards.

In sub-Saharan Africa, the numbers are completely different:

- **Only 5-10%** of the population has a credit card
- **Less than 40%** have a traditional bank account
- **Over 60%** use mobile money regularly

If you require a credit card to subscribe to your news product, you've just excluded 90% of your potential audience. That's not a minor inconvenience — it's a fundamental business model failure.

## Mobile Money Changes Everything

Mobile money — services like **MTN Mobile Money, Airtel Money, and M-Pesa** — has transformed commerce across Africa. People use it for everything: paying school fees, buying groceries, sending money to family, and paying bills.

The key advantages for news subscriptions:

### Instant Micropayments

Mobile money makes it trivial to charge small amounts. A daily newspaper for 500 UGX (about $0.13)? No problem. Try doing that with credit card processing fees.

### Universal Access

If you have a phone — even a basic feature phone — you can use mobile money. No bank account required. No credit history needed. No application forms.

### Trust

People trust mobile money. They use it daily. There's no "should I enter my card details on this website?" anxiety. Just approve the payment on your phone.

## How KandaNews Uses Mobile Money

At KandaNews, mobile money isn't an afterthought — it's the **primary payment method**. Here's how we've designed our subscription system:

### Flexible Plans

- **Daily** — Pay per day, read that day's edition
- **Weekly** — Seven days of access, one payment
- **Monthly** — Best value, full archive access

### One-Tap Payment

When you subscribe, you get a payment prompt on your phone. Approve it. Done. No forms, no typing card numbers, no redirects to third-party sites.

### Local Pricing

Each country edition is priced in local currency at rates that make sense for that market. What works in Uganda is different from Kenya or Nigeria. We price for accessibility.

## The Bigger Picture

Mobile money isn't just a payment method — it's an **identity system**. Your phone number is your user ID, your payment method, and your subscription key. One number does everything.

This is why we chose phone number authentication over social login. In Africa:

- Everyone has a phone number
- Not everyone has a Google or Apple account
- The phone number links directly to payment capability
- SMS verification works even without mobile data

**Phone number = User ID = Payment ID.** Clean, simple, and built for the African market.

## What's Coming

We're partnering with payment providers across the continent to ensure KandaNews subscriptions work seamlessly in every country we launch. Our goal: **subscribe in under 30 seconds, pay with the money already on your phone.**

The future of news in Africa won't be built on credit cards and PayPal. It'll be built on mobile money — and we're building for that future today.
