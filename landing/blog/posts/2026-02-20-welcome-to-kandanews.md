## The Problem With News in Africa

Traditional newspapers are dying globally — but in Africa, the shift is even more dramatic. Print distribution is expensive, unreliable, and doesn't reach the majority of the population. Meanwhile, **over 600 million Africans are online via mobile phones**, and that number is growing every day.

Yet most digital news platforms are built for Western audiences. They assume fast broadband, large screens, and credit card payments. That doesn't work here.

## What We're Building

KandaNews is **Africa's first digital flipping newspaper** — a mobile-first, interactive news experience designed specifically for the African market.

Here's what makes it different:

- **Flipbook Format** — Swipe through daily editions like a real newspaper, but with rich media, video, and interactive elements
- **Mobile-First** — Optimized for smartphones on 3G/4G networks. Loads fast, works offline
- **Local Pricing** — Pay with mobile money (MTN, Airtel) or card. Prices set per country in local currency
- **Multi-Platform** — Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, and Linux apps
- **Pan-Africa Coverage** — Local news for your country, plus continent-wide stories

## Where We Are Today

**KandaNews Uganda is live.** Our first country edition is publishing daily interactive editions covering business, tech, campus life, entertainment, and pan-African stories.

We're preparing launches in **Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa** — with more countries to follow.

## For Advertisers

KandaNews offers something traditional media can't: **smart, targeted advertising** inside a premium content experience. Full-page spreads, native editorial placements, audio and video sponsorships, and interactive rich-media ads.

## What's Next

Over the coming weeks, we'll be sharing:

1. Behind-the-scenes looks at how we build each edition
2. Deep dives into the African digital media landscape
3. Tips for students and professionals using news to grow
4. Updates on new country launches and app releases

**Welcome aboard.** The future of news in Africa starts here.
